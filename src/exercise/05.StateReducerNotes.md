# 5. State Reducer Notes

Concept for using a state reducer with hooks:

1. End user does action
2. Dev calls dispatch
3. Hook determines necessary changes
4. Hook calls dev's code for further changes <-- *Inversion of Control*
5. Hook makes state changes

This pattern enables users to hook into every state of reducer to make changes to it.

*Inversion of Control*: Give user control over how things work, for example by letting people provide a custom reducer.
