// Compound Components
// http://localhost:3000/isolated/exercise/02.js

import * as React from 'react'
import {Switch} from '../switch'

// In this exercise weâ€™re going to make <Toggle /> the parent of a few compound components:

// <ToggleOn /> renders children when the on state is true
// <ToggleOff /> renders children when the on state is false
// <ToggleButton /> renders the <Switch /> with the on prop set to the on state and 
// the onClick prop set to toggle.
// We have a Toggle component that manages the state, and we want to render different 
// parts of the UI however we want. We want control over the presentation of the UI.

// ðŸ¦‰ The fundamental challenge you face with an API like this is the state shared 
//between the components is implicit, meaning that the developer using your component 
// cannot actually see or interact with the state (on) or the mechanisms for updating 
// that state (toggle) that are being shared between the components.

// So in this exercise, weâ€™ll solve that problem by providing the compound components 
// with the props they need implicitly using React.cloneElement.
