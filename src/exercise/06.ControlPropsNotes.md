# 6. Control Props Notes

State reducer allows people to manage what state changes are made and when state changes happen, but sometimes people may want to make state changes themselves. 

Control props = same concept as controlled form in React. The `<input>` makes *suggestions* to you via the *onChange* prop on state updates that it would normally make itself (happens if you provide value prop, otherwise it will control state itself). This flexibility allows you to change how state is managed, and programmatically change the state whenever you want.
