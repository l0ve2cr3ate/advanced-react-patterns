# 4. Prop Collections and Prop Getters Notes

In UI components you have to take accessibility into account. A toggle button should have `aria-pressed` attribute set to true/false, depending on if it is turned on/off. For the toggle button to work, people should remember to add the onClick handler to call toggle. It would be great if you could make it easier to use your components and hooks the right way without people requiring to wire things up for common use cases. Some components have lots of props, so it can be a good idea to take the common use cases for your hook/components and make objects of props that people can spread across the UI.
