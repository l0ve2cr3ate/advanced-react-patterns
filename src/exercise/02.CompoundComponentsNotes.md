# 2. Compound Components Notes

*Compound components* are components that work together to form a complete UI, like `<select>` and `<option>`. `<select>` is responsible for managing the state of the UI, `<option>` elements are configuration for how select should operate (which options are available and their values).
Compound components are more extensible/flexible.
**Problem**: state shared between the components is implicit, the developer using your component cannot actually see or interact with the state (on) or the mechanisms for updating that state (toggle) that are being shared between the components.
**Possible solution**: Providing the compound components with props they need implicitly using `React.cloneElement`.

Example of `React.Children.map` and `React.cloneElement`:

```javascript
function Foo({children}) {
  return React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => {
    return React.cloneElement(child, {
      id: `i-am-child-${index}`,
    })
  })
}

function Bar() {
  return (
    <Foo>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-0"</div>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-1"</div>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-2"</div>
    </Foo>
  )
}
```

**Notes**: If you want to pass components without props in `React.cloneElement` you can check for the type of the child. Children without props will have a type like: `span`, so you can check for `child.type === "string"`.
